  Even for those unfamiliar with K-pop, BTS is hard to ignore. 
The seven-member boy band, which was named by Time magazine as one of the 25 most influential people on the internet, is taking the world by storm, one follower at a time. 
If you're not already on board with BTS' catchy songs, smooth moves and adorable personalities, you soon will be. Here's everything you need to know about the K-pop group.
BTS, also known as Bangtan Boys, is an acronym for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan, meaning Bulletproof Boy Scouts. In July 2017, they announced they'd also be known as Beyond the Scene as part of their new identity. 
The seven-member band was formed through auditions by Bit Hit Entertainment in 2010 and 2011, and finalized in 2012. BTS made their musical debut in 2013 with the first of their school trilogy series, their single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool. The group quickly became one of the hottest acts in South Korea, winning several New Artist of the Year awards. 
BTS evolved their identity, channeling different themes throughout their music, through eras like School, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life and Wings. In just four years, the band has completed three world tours, released four studio albums (two in Korean and two in Japanese) and five EPs, gaining millions of fans across the world -- though it was their 2017 Billboard Awards win for Top Social Artist that marked the start of their breakthrough in the U.S. 
ARMY (a fitting name for the organized passion of BTS fans) is actually an acronym for Adorable Representative MC for Youth. 
Love Yourself: Her is BTS' latest EP and the next chapter of their career. The album was pre-ordered over 1 million times over two weeks before its release on Monday, but the records don't stop there. By Tuesday, Love Yourself had already topped the iTunes Album charts at No. 1 in a record-breaking 73 countries, the largest debut release for any South Korean artist. And "DNA," the album's lead single, is also blowing up on YouTube with nearly 30 million views since its early Monday release.
